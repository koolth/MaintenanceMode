# Maintenance Mode for Processwire 3.+

As the name suggests, this module allows the website to be put into 'Maintenance Mode' and disables non-superusers from logging in. 

Locking [client] admin users out is useful if the site requires maintenance and you want to ensure no changes are made to the live site whilst enhancements/updates are being developed. 

This version of MaintenanceMode is designed for ProcessWire 3.0 or newer. 

## Configuration

A Maintenance Mode checkbox is shown in the module's configuration. When checked the site will no longer allow non-superusers to login.

## Admin Messages

When the site is in Maintenance Mode, attempts to login (by non-superusers) will be denied and a message stating the site is in 'Maintenance Mode' will be displayed. In addition, a reminder message is displayed to the superuser(s) that the site is in Maintenance Mode.


## Changelog

v1.0.0 beta (1 Nov 2016)
- Initial module development
